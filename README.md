# etch-a-sketch

The etch-a-sketch project simulates a sketchpad using Javascript. The page is structured as a grid of squares and each square changes to a random color when the cursor hovers over the square. The color of the square darkens when the cursor passes through the square more than once until the square becomes completely colored. There is also a button for the user to provide the number of squares per side of the grid to change the size of the grid.

The project uses event-driven programming to implement interactivity such as changing the color of the square and darkening the square when the cursor hovers of the square and dynamically generate content such as creating a grid of squares based on the number of squares per side provided by the user.
